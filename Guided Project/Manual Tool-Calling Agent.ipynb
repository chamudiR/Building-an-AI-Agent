You'll learn how to create custom tools that enable an LLM to perform specific actions, from extracting video IDs to fetching YouTube transcripts and metadata. Through hands-on examples, you'll first implement manual tool calling to understand the underlying mechanics, then build a flexible YouTube interaction system that can search videos, extract transcripts, fetch trending content, and generate summaries. By the end of this lab, you'll understand how to construct both fixed-sequence and recursive tool-calling chains, allowing your AI assistants to dynamically decide which tools to use and when to use them, creating truly intelligent agents that can reason about and interact with the world around them.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2ccc7524-71de-403c-ab55-37216366ff3b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## __Table of Contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","   <li><a
